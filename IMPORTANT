1. atomic data type
	AFFECTED FILE(S): tpl_utils.h
	DESCRIPTION:
		Both ARM Mali Midgard and Utgard use unsigned int as atomic int
		type. Currently, tpl_utikl_osu_atomic is typedef'ed from
		unsigned int. However, this could change in future releases of
		respective DDKs, and appropriate typedef must be made or
		memory corruption will occur.
2. TPL initialization
	AFFECTED FILE(S): tpl.c
	DESCRIPTION:
		Upon starting EGL (usually, eglGetDisplay()), tpl_egl_funcs_t
		must be created in the DDK's EGL porting layer, and its pointer
		must be passed as argument to tpl_set_egl_funcs(). Failure to
		do so will result in a segmentation fault.
